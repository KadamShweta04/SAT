This chapter describes the experiments that were done with this tool in the attempt to validate a proof sketch that Prof. Dr. Mihalis Yannakakis submitted \cite{yannakakis1986four}.\\
As mentioned in chapter \autoref{GT}, Prof. Yannakakis discovered that planar graphs need at most 4 pages in a stack embedding, yet no researcher managed to find a planar graph that actually requires four pages to be embedded. Yannakakis himself gave a sketch \cite{yannakakis1986four} on how to construct such a graph in an extended abstract of a symposium contribution, but ...\\
The proof sketch is made up of three steps, three graphs to be found which in combination would lead to a graph that is only embeddable in four pages. These ideas of graphs are as follows:\\

In the first step
