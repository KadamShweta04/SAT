This chapter describes the experiments that were done with this tool in the attempt to validate a proof sketch that ... by Prof. Dr. Mihalis Yannakakis \cite{yannakakis1986four}.\\
As mentioned in chapter \autoref{GT}, Prof. Yannakakis discovered that planar graphs need at most 4 pages in a stack embedding, but yet no researcher managed to find a planar graph that actually requires four pages to be embedded.
Yannakakis himself gave a sketch on how to construct such a graph in an extended abstract of a symposium contribution, but ...\\
The proof sketch is made up of three steps, three graphs to be found in order to achieve a graph that is embeddable in 4 pages.\\
